# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

* dplyr is called as required to perform subsequent functions
* Data and Data Labels are merged using `rbind()` function. 
* Mean and Standard Deviation measurement columns are extracts
* A new dataset(`averages_data.txt`) with average measures for each subject and activity type is created

# Variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x`, `y` and `s` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct column names for the `x_data` dataset,
* `index_features`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
* 'activities' contains the correct descriptions for the actvities in the data set
* `tidyDataSet` merges `x`, `y` and `s`.
* `tidyDataAVGSet` averages each variable for each activity and subject.
